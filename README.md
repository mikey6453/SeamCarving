Image Carving Application
This image carving application, developed by Michael Park, is designed to perform content-aware image resizing using the Seam Carving technique. Seam Carving is a method for resizing images while preserving the most important visual content by removing or adding seams of pixels from the image. This technique is particularly useful when traditional resizing methods may result in the distortion or cropping of essential parts of an image.

Introduction
Image Carving is a process that involves intelligently resizing an image to meet specific width or height requirements while maintaining the visual integrity of the content. Unlike traditional resizing, which uniformly scales an image, Seam Carving identifies and removes or adds seams, which are continuous paths of pixels, in a way that minimizes the visual impact on the image's content.

How the Dynamic Programming/Backtracking Algorithm Works
This application utilizes a dynamic programming and backtracking algorithm to perform Seam Carving:

Energy Calculation: It starts by calculating the energy of each pixel in the image. The energy represents the importance of a pixel and is computed based on the differences in color intensity between neighboring pixels.

Dynamic Programming: The algorithm then builds a dynamic programming (DP) matrix to store the cumulative seam energy values. Each cell in the DP matrix represents the minimum energy required to reach that pixel from the top of the image while traversing through previously computed minimum-energy paths.

Seam Identification: After constructing the DP matrix, the algorithm identifies the seam with the least cumulative energy by tracing back from the bottom row of the matrix. This seam represents the path of pixels to be removed or added.

Seam Removal/Addition: The identified seam is removed (or added, depending on the resizing direction) by adjusting the image's pixel values.

Repeat: Steps 1 to 4 are repeated iteratively until the desired width or height is achieved.

Setup
To set up and run this Image Carving application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub.

Install the necessary dependencies by running:
pip install Pillow

Run the application by executing the main.py file:
python main.py

Usage
Launch the application by following the setup instructions.

When prompted, enter the path to the image file you want to resize.

Specify the target width for the resized image.

The application will perform Seam Carving to resize the image while preserving important content.

The resized image will be displayed, and you can choose to save it to a file.
